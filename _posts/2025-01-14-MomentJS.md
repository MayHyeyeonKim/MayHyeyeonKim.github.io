In my current work, I often need to manage dates and times in JavaScript/typeScript applications. For this, I used to rely on `Moment.js`. <br>
Let’s dive into how Moment.js works, how it simplifies date handling, and whether it’s still a good choice for modern development.

# Moment.js: Managing Dates and Times in JavaScript

## 1. What is Moment.js?

`Moment.js` is a popular JavaScript library used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times. <br>
Before modern JavaScript provided native solutions, `Moment.js` was the go-to library for developers who needed advanced date and time management.

## 2. Why do we need it?

Working with dates and times in JavaScript can be tricky. Here's why:

- Parsing and formatting dates manually is error-prone.

- Different time zones and locales can cause issues.

- Calculating date differences (like "how many days until the deadline?") requires careful handling.

`Moment.js` solves these problems by offering a simple and consistent API.

## 3. How do you use it?

### Step1. Installing `Moment.js` <br>

To use `Moment.js`, you first need to install it.

#### 1. Installation

You can install `Moment.js` using npm or a CDN.

```javascript
npm install moment
```

#### 2. Importing Moment.js

If you’re using a module bundler, import `Moment.js` like this:

```javascript
import moment from "moment";
```

### Step2. Formatting Dates and Times

Moment.js makes it easy to format dates and times in various ways.

```javascript
const now = moment();
console.log(now.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // e.g., 2025-01-13 14:30:45
```

You can use different format strings to display dates in various styles:

- `YYYY`: 4-digit year

- `MM`: 2-digit month

- `DD`: 2-digit day

- `HH`: 2-digit hour (24-hour format)

- `mm`: 2-digit minute

- `ss`: 2-digit second

### Step3. Parsing Dates

**Parsing** a date string and **converting** it into a `Moment.js` object is simple.

```javascript
const date = moment("2025-01-13", "YYYY-MM-DD");
console.log(date.format()); // 2025-01-13T00:00:00+09:00
```

### Step 4: Manipulating Dates

`Moment.js` allows you to **add** or **subtract** time units from a date.

```javascript
const nextWeek = moment().add(7, "days");
console.log(nextWeek.format("YYYY-MM-DD")); // 2025-01-20

const lastMonth = moment().subtract(1, "month");
console.log(lastMonth.format("YYYY-MM-DD")); // e.g., 2024-12-13
```

### Step 5: Calculating Date Differences

You can easily **calculate** differences between two dates.

```javascript
const start = moment("2025-01-01");
const end = moment("2025-01-13");
console.log(end.diff(start, "days")); // 12
```

### Step6. Handling Time Zones

`Moment.js` also supports time zone conversions (with an additional plugin moment-timezone). This is especially useful when working on applications that need to display the correct time for users in different parts of the world.

To use this feature, you first need to install the moment-timezone package:

```javascript
npm install moment-timezone
```

Here’s an example of converting a date and time to a specific time zone:

```javascript
import moment from "moment-timezone";
const nyTime = moment.tz("2025-01-13 14:00", "America/New_York");
console.log(nyTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // e.g., 2025-01-13 14:00:00
```

**Common Use Cases:**

**Scheduling across time zones:** If you’re building an app where users in different time zones schedule events (e.g., meetings or reminders), you can store timestamps in UTC and display them in the user’s local time zone.

```javascript
const utcTime = moment.utc("2025-01-13 19:00");
const localTime = utcTime.local();
console.log(localTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // Converts to local time zone
```

**Displaying the user’s local time:**

```javascript
const userTimeZone = moment.tz.guess(); // Automatically guesses the user's time zone
const localTime = moment.tz("2025-01-13 14:00", userTimeZone);
console.log(localTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"));
```

**Calculating time zone offsets:**
You can also calculate the time zone offset from UTC for a specific date and time.

```javascript
const offset = moment.tz("2025-01-13 14:00", "America/New_York").utcOffset();
console.log(offset); // e.g., -300 (offset in minutes)
```

Using `moment-timezone`, you can ensure that your application handles time zones correctly and provides a seamless experience for users worldwide.

`Moment.js` also supports time zone conversions (with an additional plugin `moment-timezone`).

```javascript
import moment from "moment-timezone";
const nyTime = moment.tz("2025-01-13 14:00", "America/New_York");
console.log(nyTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // e.g., 2025-01-13 14:00:00
```

### Step6-1. Handling Time Zones Use Case in Real-World Scenarios

`Moment.js` and` moment-timezone` make it straightforward to handle time zones in applications. <br>
This is particularly useful in scenarios where users in different time zones need to interact with a shared schedule, such as a tutoring app.

**Tutor Registers Available Schedule**

- The tutor inputs their available time in their local time zone (e.g., 'Asia/Seoul').

- When storing this information in the database, it should be converted to UTC.

```javascript
const tutorTime = moment.tz("2025-01-13 14:00", "Asia/Seoul");
const utcTime = tutorTime.utc();
console.log(utcTime.format()); // 2025-01-13T05:00:00Z (converted to UTC)
```

**Displaying Schedule on the Tutor's Page**

- The stored UTC time is converted back to the tutor's local time zone for display.

```javascript
const utcTime = moment.utc("2025-01-13T05:00:00Z");
const tutorLocalTime = utcTime.tz("Asia/Seoul");
console.log(tutorLocalTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // 2025-01-13 14:00:00 (in tutor's local time)
```

**Displaying Schedule on the Student's Page**

- On the student's page, the tutor's available schedule is displayed in the student's local time zone.

- The student's time zone can be automatically detected by the browser.

```javascript
const studentTimeZone = moment.tz.guess(); // Automatically detects the student's time zone
const studentLocalTime = utcTime.tz(studentTimeZone);
console.log(studentLocalTime.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")); // Converted to student's local time
```

**Summary of the Flow**

- The tutor inputs their schedule, which is stored in UTC.

- On the tutor's page, the UTC time is converted back to the tutor's time zone.

- On the student's page, the UTC time is converted to the student's time zone.

## ✅ Pros and Cons of Using Moment.js

### Pros:

- **Rich feature set:** `Moment.js` provides a comprehensive set of utilities for date and time manipulation.

- **Simple API:** Its intuitive API makes it easy to get started.

- **Locale and time zone support:** You can easily handle different locales and time zones.

### Cons:

- **Bundle size:** `Moment.js` is relatively large compared to modern alternatives.

- **Immutability:** `Moment.js` mutates the original object when manipulating dates, which can lead to bugs.

- **Deprecated:** While it still works, `Moment.js` is no longer actively maintained, and the maintainers recommend using modern alternatives like date-fns or Day.js.

## Modern Alternatives to Moment.js

`date-fns`

- Lightweight and modular.

- Provides immutable date manipulation.

`Day.js`

- API similar to `Moment.js`.

- Much smaller and faster.

`Luxon`

- Built by one of `Moment.js`’s developers.

- Provides better support for modern JavaScript features.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored how to use `Moment.js` for handling dates and times in JavaScript. While it’s still a useful tool, modern alternatives offer better performance and a smaller footprint. If you’re working on a new project, consider using `date-fns` or `Day.js` instead.
