## Introduction to AdonisJS

AdonisJS is a fully-featured and comprehensive Node.js framework that simplifies backend development by providing a well-structured and consistent ecosystem. It is designed to make building web applications and APIs seamless, with a strong emphasis on developer productivity, maintainability, and performance.

### Why AdonisJS?

1. **TypeScript First**: AdonisJS is built with TypeScript by default, providing type safety and reducing runtime errors.
2. **MVC Architecture**: It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, making it easier to organize and manage code.
3. **Integrated Ecosystem**: AdonisJS includes everything needed for backend development, such as routing, middleware, database management, authentication, and more.
4. **Lucid ORM**: An expressive and powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions.
5. **First-Class CLI Tools**: Includes powerful CLI tools for scaffolding, migrations, seeding, and testing.
6. **Extensibility**: Highly modular and supports custom packages, making it easy to extend the framework to suit your needs.
